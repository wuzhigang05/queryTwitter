##Determine the popularity of a set of technical terms (hashtags) using [Twitter-Python-API](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter)




###Project Background

This is part of my hachathon project in [OneScreen Inc](www.onescreen.com), where I am interning. We were given half of a day to come up with a game, that has to be something related to Twitter. 
The final product of our project is an Android App, which can allow users trade the stocks (hashtags) to make "money". Since most of audience are programmers, so we 
selected serveral technical terms that are of general interest to the audience, which are the name of programming languages. In order to give these hashtags a price, 
we've used a Twitter-Python-API to query the Twitter every minute. Based on the popularity of term, we assigned the hashtags a value. 

What included in this repo is the code **using Twitter-Python-API to query the hashtags, quantify them and stored the result into a sqlite3 database**.
